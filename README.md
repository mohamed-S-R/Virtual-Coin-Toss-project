# Virtual Coin Toss

## Project Overview
This Python program simulates a virtual coin toss, allowing users to flip a coin multiple times and track the results.

## Features
- Simulates a coin toss using Pythonâ€™s `random.choice()` function.
- Allows users to specify the number of flips.
- Tracks and displays the number and percentage of `Heads` and `Tails`.
- Interactive user input with the option to repeat the session.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```sh
   python virtual_coin_toss.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of flips and decide whether to repeat.

## Example Output
```
Enter the number of coin flips: 5
Toss Result: Heads
Toss Result: Tails
Toss Result: Heads
Toss Result: Heads
Toss Result: Tails

Results:
Heads: 3 (60.00%)
Tails: 2 (40.00%)

Do you want to flip again? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the Virtual Coin Toss program!
```

## Additional Notes
- If invalid input is entered, the program will prompt the user to enter a valid number.
- The program will run until the user decides to exit.
